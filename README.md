# ElliottTitusFinancial
Elliott Titus Financial (ETF) is a mock hedging and derivative operations architecture that will be utilized for educational purposes and to test new technologies, systems, and ideas.
### Technology stack
* Visual Studio Community 2017
* LinqPad 5
* SQL Server 2017 and SQL Server Management Studio
* sFTP site
* Trello

### ETF systems to be built
* Trading system to place dummy Listed Option trades with dummy counterparty banks
* Asset inventory and management system
* Transactional and internal systems reconciliation platform
* SWIFT and internal messaging system for internal accounting and external custodial banking communications

### Dummy external systems to be built
* Intraday and position reporting system
* Simple accounting system (inventory)

#### ETF Trading System
The purpose of this system is to input and create dummy listed option trades with a select set of dummy counterparty banks.
##### Learning Objectives
* Winform creation and GUI interaction/event based programming
* Create a SQL table in SQL Server Management Studio
* Learn how to use SqlMetal to create an C# object model of the table for interaction in the Winform app
* Write records into the SQL table from Winform app

#### Asset Inventory System
The purpose of this system is to keep a transaction record of all trades placed by ETF and to create an interface to enable editing of database rows in the case of data entry error or counterparty request for price change.
##### Learning Objectives
* C# data types -- specific class lists
* C# DataGridView in Winforms
* SQL updates from winforms app

#### Reconciliation Platform
The purpose of this system is to perform intraday and end of day position reconciliations with trading counterparties, as it is mission critical to ensure all positions are reconciled prior to next days business
##### Learning Objectives
* C# file i/o -- parsing CSV files
* C# data types -- specifically dictionaries
* sFTP interaction from C# -- read directory for files and download to local drive for consumption

#### Messaging Platform
The purpose of this system is to create transaction messages to both internal (accounting system) and external (custodial bank).
##### Learning Objectives
* SWIFT MT541 and MT543 FIN messages
* C# file io -- creation of flat text files from Asset Inventory system

#### Reporting System
The purpose of this system is to simulate file transfer between ETF and external banking counterparties to feed the Reconciliation Platform

#### Simple accounting system
The purpose of this system is to read in messages generated by the Messaging Platform
